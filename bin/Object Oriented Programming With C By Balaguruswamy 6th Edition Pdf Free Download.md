Object oriented programming is a paradigm that focuses on creating objects that have data and behavior, and using them to design and implement software systems. Object oriented programming with C++ helps you to learn the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding, and how to apply them in real-world problems.
 
Object Oriented Programming with C++ by E Balagurusamy covers all the important topics of object oriented programming with C++, such as classes, objects, constructors, destructors, overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, virtual functions, templates, exception handling, file handling, and STL. The book also provides numerous examples, programs, projects, review questions, and frequently asked university questions to help you master the subject.

## Benefits of Object Oriented Programming with C++
 
Object oriented programming with C++ has many benefits that make it a powerful and popular programming language. Some of the benefits are:
 
- **Portability:** C++ is a highly portable language and is often the language of choice for multi-device, multi-platform app development[^3^]. You can write C++ code once and run it on different operating systems and hardware platforms with minimal changes.
- **Reusability:** C++ is an object-oriented programming language and includes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, and encapsulation which allow code reusability and make programs very maintainable[^3^]. You can create reusable classes that can be inherited by other classes or used as components in larger systems.
- **Modularity:** C++ allows you to break down your program into smaller and independent modules that communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces. This makes your code easier to organize, test, debug, and modify[^4^]. You can also use namespaces to avoid name conflicts among different modules.
- **Performance:** C++ is a compiled language that produces efficient and fast executable code. C++ also gives you direct access to low-level features of the hardware, such as memory management and pointers, which can help you optimize your program for speed and memory usage.
- **Flexibility:** C++ is a multi-paradigm language that supports both object-oriented and procedural programming styles. You can choose the best approach for your problem domain and mix them as needed. C++ also supports generic programming through templates, which enable you to write code that works with different types of data without duplication.

These are some of the benefits of object oriented programming with C++. If you want to learn more about this topic, you can refer to Object Oriented Programming with C++ by E Balagurusamy 6th edition pdf for free download from the link given above.
